This repository contains several Java programs that cover a variety of topics, including loops, conditional statements, arrays, methods, classes, and GUI programming. Here's a brief summary of the programs in this repository:

- `Above_and_below_average`: Calculates the average of an array of numbers and determines which values are above or below the average.
- `Add_Two_Matrix`: Adds two matrices and displays the result.
- `Avg_10_values_using_array`: Calculates the average of 10 values using an array.
- `celsiusToFahrenheit_with_methods`: Converts a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit using a method.
- `check_odd_even`: Checks if a number is odd or even.
- `Check_Posive_Nagative`: Checks if a number is positive, negative, or zero.
- `Check_Vowel`: Checks if a character is a vowel or consonant.
- `Circule_calss`: Calculates the area and circumference of a circle using a class.
- `convert_pound_to_kilo`: Converts a weight in pounds to kilograms.
- `display_folowing_pattern`: Displays a specific pattern using nested loops.
- `Full_Multi_Table`: Displays the multiplication table for numbers 1-10.
- `Get_ASCII_Code`: Displays the ASCII code for a character.
- `GreatestCommonDivisorMethod`: Finds the greatest common divisor of two numbers using a method.
- `Greatest_one_Number`: Finds the greatest of three numbers.
- `GUI Projects`: ContainsJava programs that demonstrate GUI programming using Swing and AWT libraries. These programs include simple GUI applications like a calculator and a clock as well as more complex programs like a Tic Tac Toe game and a file explorer.

- `Is_Palindrome_with_methods`: Checks if a number or a string is a palindrome using a method.
- `Is_traingle_valid`: Checks if three given sides can form a triangle.
- `Loop_if_not_positve`: Prompts the user to enter a positive integer and loops until a positive integer is entered.
- `Minutes_in_years_days`: Calculates the number of minutes in a given number of years and days.
- `Month_And_Numbers`: Displays the number of days in a given month.
- `multiplication_table`: Displays the multiplication table for a given number.
- `Palindrome Number`: Checks if a number is a palindrome.
- `palindrome_Text`: Checks if a string is a palindrome.
- `Palindrome_Text_Another_way`: Another implementation of checking if a string is a palindrome.
- `Rectangle`: Calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle.
- `sort_3_numbers`: Sorts three given numbers in ascending order.
- `Stock`: Calculates the total value of a stock portfolio.
- `stopwatch`: Implements a stopwatch using threads.
- `Student`: Implements a Student class with name, roll number, and grade fields.
- `total_average`: Calculates the total and average of a given set of numbers.
- `TV`:Implements a TV class with channel and volume fields and methods to change the channel and volume.

Each program is contained in its own Java file with a descriptive name indicating its purpose. The code is commented to explain what each section of the program does. Additionally, some programs use methods or classes to demonstrate object-oriented programming concepts. 

To run any of these programs, you can compile the Java file using a Java compiler and then run the resulting class file. Some programs may require user input through the console, while others may have a GUI interface. 

Overall, this repository provides a variety of Java programs that cover different programming concepts and can be used to improve your Java skills.
